BUG? If I use names in my layers, why aren't these names stored in the checkpoint files instead of the default names? Or store both default and user names in the file.

Given a Gaussian signal, construct a mixed Gaussian model (with one Gaussian), that predicts the signal.

s(t) = N(mu, sigma)

1) mu, sigma = constants
2) mu, sigma oscillate in time. 

Objective: have the neural network predict mu and sigma as a function of time. 
Use many artificial signals as training. 
Parameters of network: mu, sigma
